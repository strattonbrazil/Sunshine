# Introduction

Sunshine is a Qt-based simple scene viewer for manipulating scene objects including cameras, geometry, and lights.  

# Building

#### Libraries
Qt requires the following libraries:
* aqsis - _open-source REYES renderer_ (http://www.aqsis.org)
* pythonqt - _binding library for C++/Python_ (included)

#### Building on the command-line
```qmake
make
./sunshine
```

The build will automatically compile and build the PythonQt libraries required by sunshine, but they will need to be installed first.  

ex. Ubuntu Linux

```sudo cp ./PythonQt2.0.1/src/*.h /usr/include
sudo cp ./PythonQt2.0.1/lib/*so* /usr/lib
```
